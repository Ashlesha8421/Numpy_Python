# Numpy is used for Mathematical Operations.
# Numpy
Numpy is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays.It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with python

# What is an array ?
An array is a data structure that stores values of same data type. In python, this is the main difference between arrays and lists. While python list can contain values corresponding to different data types. arrays in python can only contain values corresponding to same data types

# Why Use NumPy?
1. In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.

2. NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.

3. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.

4. Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.

# Which Language is NumPy written in?
NumPy is a Python library and is written partially in Python, but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++.

# To install NumPy we use :
      !pip install Numpy

# To import NumPy we use :
     from numpy import np 

# 6 Important things you should know about Numpy and Pandas
## 1.The data manipulation capabilities of pandas are built on top of the numpy library. In a way, numpy is a dependency of the pandas library.
## 2.Pandas is best at handling tabular data sets comprising different variable types (integer, float, double, etc.). In addition, the pandas library can also be used to perform even the most naive of tasks such as loading data or doing feature engineering on time series data.
## 3.Numpy is most suitable for performing basic numerical computations such as mean, median, range, etc. Alongside, it also supports the creation of multi-dimensional arrays.
## 4.Numpy library can also be used to integrate C/C++ and Fortran code.
## 5.Remember, python is a zero indexing language unlike R where indexing starts at one.
## 6.The best part of learning pandas and numpy is the strong active community support you'll get from around the world.
