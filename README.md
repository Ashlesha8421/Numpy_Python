# Numpy is used for Mathematical Operations.
# Numpy
Numpy is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays.It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with python

# What is an array ?
An array is a data structure that stores values of same data type. In python, this is the main difference between arrays and lists. While python list can contain values corresponding to different data types. arrays in python can only contain values corresponding to same data types

# Why Use NumPy?
1. In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.

2. NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.

3. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.

4. Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.

# Which Language is NumPy written in?
NumPy is a Python library and is written partially in Python, but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++.
